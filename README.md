# MXSDWindows
*Windows tools for use with the Mendix Stream Deck content*

This project contains utilities for presentations using Elgato Stream Deck. This is used for using Stream Deck on a Windows PC. In addition to this repository you will also need Content repository ([https://github.com/MxEvangelists/MXSDContent](https://github.com/MxEvangelists/MXSDContent)). If you are using a Mac you will need the Mac support repository ([https://github.com/MxEvangelists/MXSDMac](https://github.com/MxEvangelists/MXSDMac)) instead of this one.

## Download

### First time download

These Windows utilities must be installed under `C:\MendixStream`. Make this folder on your PC first if necessary.

Download the latest utilities as follows:
```
cd \MendixStream
git clone https://github.com/MxEvangelists/MXSDWindows.git
```

### Update

You can pull the latest version of the utilities using:
```
cd \MendixStream
git pull
```

## Installation

No further action should be necessary.

## Configuration

If you have multiple screens connected to your PC you may need to configure the presentations to appear on the correct one. To do this you should have the Content and Profile downloaded and opened in the Stream Deck. On the Stream Deck there should be a button for *Settings*. Click that and there will be buttons to set the screen to number 1, 2 or 3. You can try each by clicking the button, then use the Stream Deck to show one of the videos and see if it appears on the right display. If not then repeat the process with another Screen until you hit the right one.
